we are using React Router v6 to create a React application with multiple pages 
(Home, Page1, Page2, and Page3) and a layout (Mylayout). You also have a MainComp component 
that is being rendered outside the routing context,presumably for some kind of context management 
or state handling.

BrowserRouter: This component uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI and URL in sync. 
It listens for changes in the URL and renders the corresponding component for that route.

Routes: This component is a container for all the individual Route elements. In React Router v6, 
Routes replaces the previous Switch component (used in v5).

Route: This is how you define each path and the component that should be displayed when that path
 is matched.

path: The URL path that the route corresponds to.
element: The JSX element to render when the path matches.
Outlet: This is used in a layout route to render nested routes. 
It acts as a placeholder in the layout where the child route components will be displayed.

==================================================================================================

React Router v6 provides an easy way to manage routing in your app.

BrowserRouter is the router container, keeping track of the history of URLs.

Routes is the container for your Route definitions.

Route maps a specific path (like /page1) to a component (like Page1).

Outlet allows nested routes to be rendered inside a layout component.

Mylayout acts as the wrapper, displaying the common layout (e.g., header), 
while rendering different pages in the main content area via Outlet.
